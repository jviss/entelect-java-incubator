# Entelect Java Incubator

This project serves as the practical component of the Java Incubator at Entelect. The incubator is designed to get
experienced developers that are not be familiar with Java & Spring web development up to speed in a week or two of
self-study.

This repository's master branch will (eventually) show the end result of the project with versions presenting
significant milestones in the course tagged for easy reference.

Someone starting on the incubator should check out the start tag: `git checkout tags/start` and then work from that
point to achieve a similar result as the final version.
