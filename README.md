# Entelect Java Incubator

This project serves as the practical component of the Java Incubator at Entelect. The incubator is designed to get
experienced developers that are not be familiar with Java & Spring web development up to speed in a week or two of
self-study.

This repository's master branch will (eventually) show the end result of the project with versions presenting
significant milestones in the course tagged for easy reference.

Someone starting on the incubator should check out the start tag: `git checkout tags/start` and then work from that
point to achieve a similar result as the final version.

## About the application domain

The application domain for this exercise is a simple training feedback system.

Users of the system will be able to capture training courses and who should be attending them, along with the sessions
in the course and who will be presenting them. During the session attendees should capture the fact that they attended
and afterwards they may provide feedback on the session in the form of a simple star rating and a comment field.
